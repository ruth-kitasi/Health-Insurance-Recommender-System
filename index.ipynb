    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Health insurance plays a vital role in ensuring access to quality healthcare, yet many individuals in Kenya, particularly those with pre-existing conditions such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, HIV, and hypertension, face significant challenges in selecting suitable coverage. The lack of transparency, policy complexity, and financial constraints often lead to poor decision-making, leaving many either uninsured or enrolled in plans that do not adequately meet their medical needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bridge this gap, this study proposes a health insurance recommender system that leverages machine learning to provide personalized policy recommendations based on an individual's medical history, financial capacity, and coverage preferences. By analyzing user profiles, the system helps individuals navigate the complex insurance landscape and choose the most appropriate plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rising prevalence of chronic illnesses in Kenya and the increasing demand for affordable, accessible health insurance, this solution aims to enhance informed decision-making. By offering data-driven, customized suggestions, the recommender system has the potential to increase health insurance uptake, minimize financial strain from medical expenses, and support Kenya’s transition toward a more efficient, technology-driven healthcare sector."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "  \n",
    "Access to quality healthcare remains a critical issue worldwide, with millions of people relying on health insurance to manage medical expenses. However, selecting the right insurance plan is a complex process, especially for individuals with **pre-existing conditions**. Health insurance systems vary globally, with developed nations offering well-structured insurance policies, while developing regions face challenges such as affordability, lack of awareness, and policy complexity.  \n",
    " \n",
    "In Africa, healthcare financing is a significant challenge, with many people lacking proper health insurance coverage. Public health insurance schemes often have **limited coverage for chronic illnesses**, and private insurance plans remain expensive for the majority of the population. For individuals.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Kenya's healthcare system consists of both public and private insurance providers, with the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) being the main public insurer. While NHIF provides some coverage for chronic illnesses, the extent of benefits varies depending on the plan selected. Many Kenyans remain uninsured or underinsured, partly due to a lack of personalized guidance on selecting the most suitable insurance policy. Individuals with pre-existing conditions often face difficulties in identifying plans that offer adequate coverage at an affordable cost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, this study develops a health insurance recommender system that helps users choose the best insurance plan based on their medical history, budget, and coverage needs. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system will analyze user data to provide personalized recommendations, making health insurance selection impler, more accessible, and more effective for Kenyans**. Ultimately, this solution aims to increase health insurance adoption, improve healthcare access, and enhance financial protection for individuals with underlying conditions.  \n"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the growing need for health insurance coverage in Kenya, many individuals, particularly those with pre-existing conditions such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, HIV, and hypertension, struggle to select suitable insurance plans that meet their medical needs and financial capacity. The complexity of policy terms, lack of personalized guidance, and financial constraints often lead to underinsurance, delayed medical care, or complete lack of coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing public insurance schemes such as the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) provide limited benefits for chronic illnesses, while private insurance options remain expensive and difficult to navigate. Many Kenyans lack access to reliable information on how to choose the most cost-effective and comprehensive plan based on their unique healthcare needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a data-driven, personalized approach, individuals are left to make uninformed decisions, increasing their financial vulnerability and reducing access to quality healthcare services. There is a pressing need for a systematic, technology-driven solution that can analyze individual health profiles, budget constraints, and policy features to guide users in selecting the most appropriate insurance plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study addresses this gap by exploring how machine learning can be leveraged to develop a health insurance recommender system that provides personalized recommendations based on medical history, financial capacity, and coverage needs. By enhancing accessibility and affordability, such a system has the potential to improve insurance adoption rates and contribute to a more inclusive healthcare system in Kenya."

    "## Objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Develop a recommender system that provides personalized insurance recommendations by analyzing a user’s pre-existing conditions, financial capacity, and required benefits, ensuring they select the most suitable coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement techniques such as demographic-based recommendations, collaborative filtering, and default user profiles to ensure that new users receive relevant insurance suggestions even with minimal historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Analyze the impact of socioeconomic factors (e.g., age, gender, income, and location) on health insurance adoption and affordability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Identify gaps in insurance coverage by evaluating how individuals with chronic illnesses (asthma, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, HIV) are insured across different income levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Develop an affordability-based insurance segmentation model to recommend the best plans for low-income individuals while ensuring sufficient coverage for chronic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Assess the role of policy attributes (e.g., premium cost, deductibles, and benefits) in determining user preferences for health insurance selection.\n"

    "## Formulating Hypothesis\n",
    "- Income level significantly affects health insurance selection, with higher-income individuals opting for more comprehensive plans while lower-income individuals choose more affordable but limited coverage options.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions are more likely to seek or have health insurance coverage compared to those without such conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Policy attributes such as premium costs, deductibles, and coverage limits do not significantly affect a user's preference for health insurance plans"

    "## Data Collection and  Limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Source`: A synthetic dataset with 50,000 records, reflecting Kenya health insurance trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Lack of Real-World Variability`\n",
    "The dataset may not capture the true complexity of real-world insurance data, such as unexpected trends, outliers, or extreme cases that naturally occur in real populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Potential Bias in Data Distribution`\n",
    "The data generation process may have introduced biases, such as uniform income distribution, unrealistic correlations between variables, or oversimplified health conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ` No Real-World Behavioral Patterns`\n",
    "Unlike real datasets that capture human decision-making, synthetic data lacks true user behaviors, preferences, and external influences (e.g., government policies, market trends).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Inability to Validate Against Ground Truth`\n",
    "Since the dataset is not based on actual surveys, insurance records, or healthcare data, there is no ground truth to compare findings against, limiting the credibility of insights derived.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Simplified Insurance Plan Attributes`\n",
    "The dataset might not include key features that influence real-world insurance selection, such as policy exclusions, co-payments, waiting periods, or insurer reputation"
